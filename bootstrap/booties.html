	  <p>I am not a killer. Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. I am not a killer. Watching ice melt. This is fun. Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment.

	    I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I'm real proud of you for coming, bro. I know you hate funerals. Like a sloth. I can do that. Hello, Dexter Morgan. Hello, Dexter Morgan.

	    Under normal circumstances, I'd take that as a compliment. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Keep your mind limber. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized.

	    I'm doing mental jumping jacks. Finding a needle in a haystack isn't hard when every straw is computerized. Oh I beg to differ, I think we have a lot to discuss. After all, you are a client. I'm Dexter, and I'm not sure what I am.

	    Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Cops, another community I'm not part of.</p>

	      You all right, Dexter? Watching ice melt. This is fun. He taught me a code. To survive. I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see.

	      I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. I will not kill my sister. God created pudding, and then he rested. You lookâ€¦perfect. Only you could make those words cute.

	      Tonight's the night. And it's going to happen again and again. It has to happen. Pretend. You pretend the feelings are there, for the world, for the people around you. Who knows? Maybe one day they will be.
